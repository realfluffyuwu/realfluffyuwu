## About me
I'm just a Wanna be Game Developer from Australia and I love RTS Games.

### Working On
Building Games Solo in **Godot**.   
**The Dungeon Corruption**: Medieval Dungeon Explorer Extraction Game.
**Private Breachers**: a FPS-RTS Hybrid Swat Style Game.  
**Reapers**: Horde Shooter but with Mechs, because I love Mechs we need more games with them.
